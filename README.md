Created a Docker file for hosting a plumi site.
I meant to host some tech videos instead of putting them on Youtube...

I'll just leave this here.  Use it if it's useful for you.

Usage:

1) Look at/modify site.cfg

2) Build image
```
$ make build
```
3) Start a container
```
$ make run
```
and so on...  I don't guarantee this to be out of the box ready or anything.
